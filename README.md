# Henry

Henry is my first attemp to learn ML ðŸ˜† So don't be too rude with him!

Put a name of an animal in your mind, and he'll ask you about some attributes of that animal, like "is it .."
Answer him as Y for (yes) or N for (no),
if he loses, he'll ask you some question to learn more and he'll insist you to play again with him, and each time he'll learn more and improve his performance..

Please don't hesistate to share me some suggestions from your experience, this will help me to learn more!
